The better submit button

AJAX forms suck.  How many times have you tried to make a simple form only to find that you need to pull in some huge-ass library to make it behave the way you want?

Submit.me lets you mitigate the suckiness without introducing any new libraries, styles, or markup.  It's just a button.  Seriously.  One line.
